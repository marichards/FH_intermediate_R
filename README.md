## Welcome to Intermediate R

This is the portal to Intermediate R, a class in the [Fredhutch.io series](http://www.fredhutch.io) using the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) platform. In addition to the Github repository itself, this portal currently provides direct links to:

- [Introductory slides](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Intermediate_R_Intro.html)
- [Instructions on Using ```swirl```](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/User_Guides/Using_swirl.html)
- [A Brief Intro to Git/Github](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/User_Guides/Intro_to_Github.html)
- [A Glossary of R Commands](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/R_Glossary.html)
- [Useful Terminal Commands](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Terminal_Commands.html)

As the course goes on, you can expect to find more resources here. In particular, I will be posting in-class activities and some sample solutions each week. 

## Class Schedule

The class is from 2-4 PM on Thursday afternoons and runs for 7 weeks. Our room  should be consistent for all 7 weeks, but if there are unexpected changes, I will update them here. Here is the most current schedule:

Date |  Room # | Topic
---- | -------- | ---------
7/6 | M3-A805 | Intro, Control Flow
7/13 | M3-A805 | Functions, The "apply" Family, Misc.
7/20 | M3-A805 | dplyr: select/filter/mutate/arrange
7/27 | M3-A805 | dplyr: summarise/group_by
8/3 | M3-A805 | dplyr: Simple Joins
8/10 | M3-A805 | dplyr: Advanced Joins
8/17 | M3-A805 | RMarkdown

## Weekly Materials

The following space includes resources for each week of the course and will be updated as the course progresses. 

### Week 1 

- Here is a link to the [Week 1 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_1/Week_1_Materials.html). These materials quickly summarize the important takeaways from the week's DataCamp lessons, add a couple new pieces of information, and provide some practice exercises for the class session. 

### Week 2

- I've created a very short [slide deck](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_2/Week_2_Slides.html) that focuses on coding approach, specifically by encouraging pseudocoding. 
- Here are the [Week 2 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_2/Week_2_Materials.html). These include some additional materials and activities on the `apply` family and regular expressions. The latter were covered only briefly in the DataCamp lessons, and my materials will greatly expand on them

### Week 3
- Here are the [Week 3 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_3/Week_3_Materials.html), which include some additional functions in `dplyr` and some extra exercises to work on during class. 

### Week 4
- Here are the [Week 4 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_4/Week_4_Materials.html). This is the 2nd lesson on `dplyr`, which finishes the introduction to the main "verbs" in `dplyr` and also covers pipes (`%>%`).

### Week 5
- Here are the [Week 5 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_5/Week_5_Materials.html). This lesson goes into SQL-style joins and other commands to assemble data.

### Week 6
- Here are the [Week 6 Materials](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Week_6/Week_6_Materials.html). These materials build out the SQL style of writing queries, a useful skill to couple with your knowledge of `dplyr`.
