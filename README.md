## Welcome to Intermediate R

This is the portal to Intermediate R, a class in the [Fredhutch.io series](http://www.fredhutch.io) using the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) platform. In addition to the Github repository itself, this portal currently provides direct links to:

- [Introductory slides](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Intermediate_R_Intro.html)
- [Instructions on Using ```swirl```](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Using_swirl.html)
- Downloading the [Rough Course Outline](https://github.com/marichards/FH_intermediate_R/raw/master/Intermediate%20R%20Outline.docx)

As the course goes on, you can expect to find more resources here.

- Link to download the [Poker Hands Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/poker/poker-hand-training-true.data)
- Description of the [Week 2 Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/poker/poker-hand.names)

### Week 3 

- A series of short videos explaining Git and Github is available from FreeCodeCamp.com; you can find them on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkFiqHnNaxpOPhh9tSWMXIF) 

### Week 4

- We'll be doing an in-class exercise using some data from my own research. The data can be found in the `mayo.tcx.rds` file in the repository; alternatively, it can be directly downloaded [here](https://github.com/marichards/FH_intermediate_R/raw/master/mayo.tcx.rds)
- Instructions can be found in a Jupyter Notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marichards/FH_Intermediate_R/blob/master/Week%204%20In%20Class%20Work.ipynb)

### Week 5

- I've created a short intro to parallelization that you can read [here](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Into_to_Parallel.html)
- The DataCamp materials gave a very brief intro to regular expressions; we'll be going more in depth and doing work with these in class. As such, here are two brief videos from Jeff Leek at Johns Hopkins University that talk a lot more about regular expressions in R. 

    - [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD8QZVRftDE)
    
    - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i5n9lu43bc)
    
- For the in-class activity, we'll be using the KEGG compounds data which you can download [here](https://github.com/marichards/FH_intermediate_R/raw/master/keggcompounds.txt)
- Instructions can be found in a Jupyter Notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marichards/FH_Intermediate_R/blob/master/Week_5_In_Class_Work.ipynb)

### Week 6

- During class, we'll be doing some analysis on breast cancer data and creating short reports in R Markdown. You can find the description of the task [here](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Intro_to_Markdown.html)
- I created an example markdown document that you can take a look at if you'd like some guidance. You can check out the HTML version [here](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Breast_Cancer_Analysis.html), but if you want to see the actual markdown, you should grab the markdown version [here](https://github.com/marichards/FH_intermediate_R/blob/master/Breast_Cancer_Analysis.Rmd) and take a look at it in RStudio. 

- We'll also touch on Jupyter notebooks and, time allowing, we'll create one in class where we'll do some more text manipulation. If you have yet to install Jupyter, I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
- The data we'll use in Jupyter are motif records from the [JASPAR](http://jaspar.genereg.net) and [HOMER](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/) databases. 
- During class, I created a Jupyter notebook with brief instructions for comparing transcription factors from the 2 above motif databases. I encourage you to download or copy my notebook so you can attempt the exercise within the Jupyter framework. The notebook is [here](https://github.com/marichards/FH_intermediate_R/blob/master/In-Class%20Notebook.ipynb).
