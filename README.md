## Welcome to Intermediate R

This is the portal to Intermediate R, a class in the [Fredhutch.io series](http://www.fredhutch.io) using the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) platform. In addition to the Github repository itself, this portal currently provides direct links to:

- [Introductory slides](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/Intermediate_R_Intro.html)
- [Instructions on Using ```swirl```](https://marichards.github.io/FH_intermediate_R/User_Guides/Using_swirl.html)

As the course goes on, you can expect to find more resources here. In particular, I will be posting in-class activities and some sample solutions each week. 

## Class Schedule

The class is from 2-4 PM on Thursday afternoons and runs for 7 weeks. Our room  should be consistent for all 7 weeks, but if there are unexpected changes, I will update them here. Here is the most current schedule:
